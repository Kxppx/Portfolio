    <h1>Resume page</h1>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I’m someone who loves exploring creativity and
      challenges in other ways—whether that’s playing video games, listening to
      music across a wide range of genres, or enjoying the thrill of sports
      bikes. Just like with programming, I’m always curious, eager to learn, and
      looking for the next challenge that keeps me moving forward.
