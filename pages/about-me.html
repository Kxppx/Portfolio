        <h1>Developer in Progress | Biker at Heart | Gamer by Passion</h1>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™m someone who loves exploring creativity and
          challenges in other ways, whether thatâ€™s playing video games,
          listening to music across a wide range of genres, or enjoying the
          thrill of sports bikes. Just like with programming, Iâ€™m always
          curious, eager to learn, and looking for the next challenge that keeps
          me moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the idea of freedom and adrenaline, which is
          why owning a bike â€” specifically a Kawasaki Ninja 500 â€” is at the top
          of my list. I canâ€™t wait to finally ride one and experience the mix of
          speed and open-road independence that Iâ€™ve been craving. Itâ€™s more
          than just transportation for me; it represents chasing the sense of
          freedom I want in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music is another big part of who I am â€” I genuinely need it to
          function at my best. Whether itâ€™s coding, studying, or even just
          relaxing, the right playlist fuels my focus and creativity. Itâ€™s the
          background rhythm that keeps me going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaming has also been a huge chapter in my life. Iâ€™ve been playing
          video games since I was 5, and by 16 I was competing at a professional
          level. While Iâ€™ve set it aside recently to focus on bigger goals, I
          used to reach top rankings in multiple games. One of my most memorable
          experiences was being flown out to a million-dollar tournament, where
          my team placed third in the semifinals. We didnâ€™t advance to the
          finals, but the experience taught me a lot about discipline, handling
          pressure, and how far dedication can take you. These days, Iâ€™ve
          shifted that same focus and dedication into coding and personal
          growth, but the lessons I learned from those competitions still stick
          with me.
