        <h1>Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner</h1>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™m someone who loves exploring creativity and
          challenges in other ways, whether thatâ€™s playing video games,
          listening to music across a wide range of genres, or dreaming about
          the thrill of sport motorcycles. Just like with programming, Iâ€™m
          always curious, eager to learn, and looking for the next challenge
          that keeps me moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the idea of freedom and adrenaline, which is
          why owning a bike, specifically a Kawasaki Ninja 500, is a goal Iâ€™m
          working toward. I canâ€™t wait to finally ride one and experience the
          mix of speed and open-road independence that Iâ€™ve been craving. Itâ€™s
          more than just transportation for me; it represents chasing the sense
          of freedom I want in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music is another big part of who I am. I genuinely need it to function
          at my best. Whether itâ€™s coding, studying, or even just relaxing, the
          right playlist fuels my focus and creativity. Itâ€™s the background
          rhythm that keeps me going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaming has also been a huge chapter in my life. Iâ€™ve been playing
          video games since I was 5, and for several years, I reached top
          rankings in multiple games and even competed in large tournaments.
          While Iâ€™ve set it aside recently to focus on bigger goals, the lessons
          I learned from those experiences â€” discipline, handling pressure, and
          dedication â€” still stick with me. These days, I channel that same
          focus and perseverance into coding and personal growth.
